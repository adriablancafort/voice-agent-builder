# PhoneFlow - The Open Source Voice Agent Platform

Build voice agents by connecting nodes, deploy them to handle inbound and outbound phone calls, and monitor every call and its cost.

## Features

- **Visual flow builder**: Build agents as a graph of nodes and edges by connecting them on a canvas. The conversation starts at the start node and branches through different paths based on transition conditions. Each node carries a prompt, each edge defines a condition that moves the conversation forward when met.
- **Provider, model and voice selection**: Mix and match STT, LLM and TTS providers, models and voices, with the price per minute shown for each option.
- **Dynamic variables**: A lightweight templating engine lets you parameterize prompts and fill in values at runtime.
- **In-editor testing**: Test your agents as you iterate right from the editor side panel.
- **Version control**: Publish immutable agent versions so you can iterate with confidence, switch between versions, and roll back at any time.
- **Phone numbers**: Import numbers from any provider (Twilio, Telnyx, Zadarma, …) by filling in the number and its SIP credentials.
- **Inbound and outbound calls**: Route incoming calls to a chosen agent and version, and trigger outbound calls to any number with any agent and version.
- **Call monitoring**: Watch every call in real time with visibility into start time, duration, cost (broken down by model), channel (phone or web), direction (inbound or outbound), from/to numbers, and the agent and version that answered.
